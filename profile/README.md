# About Us

**We launch open and ethical startups targeting high-impact challenges.**

Aeris-Taiko Corporation is a Texas-based parent company focused on building principled, public-interest technologies. We believe modern companies should be transparent by default, auditable and composable by design, and governed in the open.

This GitHub organization houses the governance stack that powers our products and divisions, including:

- **[Arcanum](https://github.com/atc-arcanum)** — Our special projects and engineering division
- **[HealthSight](https://github.com/atc-healthsight)** — Data visualization research and mobile apps for human (and critter) healthcare
- **[Critter Concierge](https://github.com/critter-concierge)** — A just-in-case system that ensures your animals are never forgotten

## Principles

We operate under the belief that the best systems:
- Are **open** by design
- Center around **sovereignty**, **trust**, and **consent**
- Invite **inspection** and thrive on **critique**
- Are designed to be **reused and improved**, not hoarded and immutable
