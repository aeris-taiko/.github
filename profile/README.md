# About Us

**We launch open and ethical startups targeting high-impact challenges.**

Aeris-Taiko Corporation is a Texas-based parent company focused on building principled, public-interest technologies. We believe modern companies should be transparent by default, auditable and composable by design, and governed in the open.

This GitHub org houses the governance stack that powers our internal divisions — including:

- **[Arcanum](https://github.com/atc-arcanum)** — Special projects and engineering
- **HealthSight** — Data viz and apps for human (and critter) healthcare
- **Critter Concierge** — A just-in-case system that ensures your animals are never forgotten.

## Principles

We operate under the belief that the best systems:
- Are **open** by design
- Center around **sovereignty**, **trust**, and **consent**
- Invite **inspection** and thrive on **critique**
- Are designed to be **reused and improved**, not hoarded and immutable

## Open Platform

We’ve open-sourced the foundational infrastructure behind Aeris-Taiko. Within this org's repositories, you'll find:

- **Our Mission Statement** - A declaration of our intended purpose and most important values
- **Our Corporate Charter** – A reusable company framework for mission-aligned orgs
- **Bylaws & Other Docs** – Any docs that support transparent governance, including meeting templates and board decisions
- **Onboarding & Playbooks** – Public versions of our internal guides for teams, project groups, and new team members

### What's not in our repositories

Other orgs are welcome to clone, adapt, and extend any of these materials — we encourage it.
