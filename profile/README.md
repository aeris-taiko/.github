# About Us

**We launch open and ethical startups targeting high-impact challenges.**

Aeris-Taiko Corporation is a Texas-based parent company focused on building principled, public-interest technologies. We believe modern companies should be transparent by default, auditable and composable by design, and governed in the open.

This GitHub org houses the code, infra, and governance stack that powers our internal divisions — including:

- **[Arcanum](https://github.com/atc-arcanum)** — special projects and engineering
- **HealthSight** — healthcare-facing data viz and apps
- **Critter Concierge** — A just-in-case system that ensures your animals are never forgotten.

## 🧱 ATC's Open Platform

We’ve open-sourced the foundational infrastructure behind Aeris-Taiko, including:

- **The Corporate Charter** – A reusable company framework for mission-aligned orgs
- **Bylaws & Board Docs** – Documenting transparent governance, including meeting templates and board decisions
- **Onboarding Playbooks** – Public versions of our internal guides to help team members get started

Other orgs are welcome to clone, adapt, and extend any of these materials — we encourage it.

## 🌐 Principles

We operate under the belief that the best systems:
- Are **open** by design
- Center around **sovereignty**, **trust**, and **consent**
- Make governance **inspectable**, not opaque
- Are designed to be **reused and improved**, not hoarded and immutable
